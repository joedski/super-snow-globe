Super Snow Globe!
=================

A simple Adafruit Trinket based project to make glowy lights that do things when shaken!

I also wanted to make the base animation code a bit easier to reuse using the power of C++ classes. (well, structs.  But C++ structs are just classes that are default-public.)  Hopefully I don't eat all of my progmem. :B
